There are currently 5+ patterns in both init.cpp (parallelized) and serial-gol.cpp (provided serial) to test and compare.
You can uncomment the function line in main to determine which function to run (or uncomment all of them if you are feeling funky).
Several of them require large dimensions so please view at the very bottom of each file if nothing prints.
Both init.cpp and serial-gol.cpp have the same output for these various patterns :)
